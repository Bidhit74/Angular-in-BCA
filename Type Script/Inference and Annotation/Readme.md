# Type Inference

-   TypeScript automatically determines the type based on the assigned value.
-   -   Example: let age = 25; (Type inferred as number).

# Type Annotation

-   You explicitly specify the type for variables or functions.
-   -   Example: let age: number = 25;

# Key Difference:

-   Inference: Automatic and concise.
-   Annotation: Explicit and strict.
